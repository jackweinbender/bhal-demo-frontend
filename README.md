# Demo Frontend for the Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon

This project was my initial prototype for the front end of the Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon (BHAL) project (the API repo [can be found here](https://github.com/jackweinbender/bhal-demo-api)). This prototype sketched the basic functionality of how the editorial team would go about its task. I spent a lot of time thinking about the ergonomics of the processes that the editorial team had established and tried to make this UI compliment those processes as best as I could.

## About the Project

This was my first time building something with Ember.js that was more than just a "toy" project. The original API was built with Node/Express, but later ported to PHP/Laravel. This was only ever meant to be a prototype to show the long-term development team what we wanted from the editor, but the project lost funding.
